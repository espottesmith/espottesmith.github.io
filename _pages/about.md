I am a computational and data chemist with a background in materials science, electrochemistry, and energy storage.
In my research, I apply computational simulations (e.g. quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics) and data science (e.g. reaction networks, machine learning) to understand reactivity in complex environments.
Much of my recent work has focused on applications in electrolyte decomposition in metal-ion (especially Li-ion and Mg-ion) batteries, but I'm broadly interested in electrochemistry, catalysis, and sustainability.

I am an incoming Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), planning to start in Fall 2025. I'm currently a Carnegie Bosch Institute Fellow, collaborating with [Prof. Rachel Kurchin](https://acme-group-cmu.github.io/) in the Materials Science and Engineering department at CMU, and I previously completed a postdoctoral fellowship working with [Prof. Gabe dos Passos Gomes](https://gomesgroup.andrew.cmu.edu/index.html), also at CMU. 
My research focuses on combining machine learning with simulations to optimize (electro)chemical reactions, with applications in the areas of catalysis and sustainability.
I'm also thinking about developing ethical standards and policy to guide applications of machine learning, particularly in the chemical sciences.

I obtained my PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, where I was advised by [Prof. Kristin Aslaug Persson](https://perssongroup.lbl.gov).
During my time at UC Berkeley, I held the [Philomathia Graduate Student Fellowship](https://kavli.berkeley.edu/evan-walter-clark-spotte-smith) through the Kavli Energy Nanoscience Institute.

Prior to attending UC Berkeley, I received my Bachelor of Science in Materials Science and Engineering from Columbia University
in 2019.
During my undergraduate education, I conducted research on nanoparticle self-assembly dynamics with
[Irving P. Herman](http://www.columbia.edu/~iph1/index.html) and explored organic reactions for thermochemical energy
storage applications with [Anubhav Jain](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/) and [Ravi Prasher](https://www.bloomenergy.com/team/ravi-prasher/)
at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
