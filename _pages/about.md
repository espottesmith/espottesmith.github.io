My name is Evan Walter Clark Spotte-Smith.
I am a chemist with a background in materials science, electrochemistry, and energy storage.
Starting September 2025, I will be an Ad Astra Fellow and Assistant Professor of Digital Chemistry at University College Dublin (UCD) in the Republic of Ireland.
I am also the founder of the [Community of Researchers Assessing Chemical Transformations and Exploring Reactivity](https://coreacter.org) (CoReACTER), an anti-oppressive research organization that began at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) but is now primarily based at UCD.

In my research, I apply computational simulations (_e.g._, quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics) and data science (_e.g._, reaction networks, machine learning) to understand reactivity in complex environments.
Much of my recent work has focused on applications in electrolyte decomposition in metal-ion (especially Li-ion and Mg-ion) batteries, but I'm broadly interested in electrochemistry, catalysis, and sustainability.
I'm also thinking about developing ethical standards and policy to guide applications of machine learning, particularly in the chemical sciences.

## Background

I'm currently a [Carnegie Bosch Institute Fellow](https://carnegiebosch.cmu.edu/news/2024/07/29-new-cbi-fellows.html), collaborating with [Prof. Rachel Kurchin](https://acme-group-cmu.github.io/) in the Materials Science and Engineering department at CMU, and I previously completed a postdoctoral fellowship working with [Prof. Gabe dos Passos Gomes](https://gomesgroup.andrew.cmu.edu/index.html), also at CMU.

I obtained my PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, where I was advised by [Prof. Kristin Aslaug Persson](https://perssongroup.lbl.gov).
During my PhD studies, I held the [Philomathia Graduate Student Fellowship](https://kavli.berkeley.edu/evan-walter-clark-spotte-smith) through the Kavli Energy Nanoscience Institute.

Prior to attending UC Berkeley, I received my Bachelor of Science in Materials Science and Engineering from Columbia University
in 2019.
During my undergraduate education, I conducted research on nanoparticle self-assembly dynamics with [Irving P. Herman](http://www.columbia.edu/~iph1/index.html) and explored organic reactions for thermochemical energy storage applications with [Anubhav Jain](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/) and [Ravi Prasher](https://www.bloomenergy.com/team/ravi-prasher/) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
