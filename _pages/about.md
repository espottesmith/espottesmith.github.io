I am a PhD candidate in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley)
and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). I am advised by Professor [Kristin Aslaug Persson](https://perssongroup.lbl.gov),
and I was formerly a Kavli Energy Nanoscience Institute [Philomathia Graduate Student Fellow](https://kavli.berkeley.edu/evan-walter-clark-spotte-smith).
In my doctoral research, I have collaborated closely with scholars within the Joint Center for Energy Storage 
Research ([JCESR](https://www.jcesr.org/)), the Silicon Consortium Project, and the Disordered Rock Salt Consortium.

My current research focuses on understanding the (electro)chemical reaction mechanisms that control
electrolyte decomposition and interphase formation in metal-ion (especially Li-ion and Mg-ion) batteries.
I use a variety of computational and theoretical techniques - primarily density functional theory, chemical reaction networks,
and Monte Carlo methods, as well as data science and machine learning - to predict stable decomposition products, identify
thermodynamically and kinetically feasible reaction pathways, and assess reactive competition. More broadly, I am interested
in theoretical studies of reactivity in complex (electro)chemical environments. 

Prior to attending UC Berkeley, I received my Bachelor of Science in Materials Science and Engineering from Columbia University
in 2019. During my undergraduate education, I conducted research on nanoparticle self-assembly dynamics with
[Irving P. Herman](http://www.columbia.edu/~iph1/index.html) and explored organic reactions for thermochemical energy
storage applications with [Anubhav Jain](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/) and [Ravi Prasher](https://thermalenergy.lbl.gov/)
of LBNL.
