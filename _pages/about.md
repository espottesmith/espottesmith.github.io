I am a PhD candidate in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley
and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). I am advised by Professor [Kristin Aslaug Persson](https://perssongroup.lbl.gov),
and I am currently a Kavli Energy Nanoscience Institute [Philomathia Graduate Student Fellow](https://kavli.berkeley.edu/evan-walter-clark-spotte-smith).
I collaborate closely with scholars within the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research ([JCESR](https://www.jcesr.org/)) and
the Silicon Consortium Project.

My current research focuses on understanding the (electro)chemical reaction mechanisms that control
solid-electrolyte interphase formation in metal-ion batteries (especially Li-ion and Mg-ion). I use a variety
of computational and theoretical techniques - primarily density functional theory and Monte Carlo methods
as well as graph theory and machine learning - to predict stable products, identify thermodynamically and kinetically
feasible reaction pathways, and assess reactive competition. More broadly, I am interested in theoretical studies of reactivity
in complex (electro)chemical environments. 

I received my Bachelor of Science in Materials Science and Engineering from Columbia University in 2019.
During my undergraduate education, I conducted research on nanoparticle self-assembly dynamics with
[Irving P. Herman](http://www.columbia.edu/~iph1/index.html) and explored organic reactions for thermochemical energy
storage applications with [Anubhav Jain](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/)  and [Ravi Prasher](https://thermalenergy.lbl.gov/)
of LBNL.
