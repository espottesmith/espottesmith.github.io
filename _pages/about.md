I am a computational chemist with a background in materials science, electrochemistry, and energy storage.
My research focuses broadly on applying quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, and data science to understand molecular reactivity in complex environments.
I design databases of molecular and reaction properties, develop methods to construct and explore chemical reaction networks, and leverage those data and methods to understand reaction mechanisms.
Much of my recent work has focused on applications in electrolyte decomposition in metal-ion (especially Li-ion and Mg-ion) batteries, but I'm broadly interested in theoretical studies of electrochemistry and catalysis.

I recently obtained my PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley.
I was advised by Professor [Kristin Aslaug Persson](https://perssongroup.lbl.gov), and I performed most of my work in collaboration with scholars within the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research ([JCESR](https://www.jcesr.org/)), the Silicon Consortium Project, and the Disordered Rock Salt Consortium.
I was formerly a Kavli Energy Nanoscience Institute [Philomathia Graduate Student Fellow](https://kavli.berkeley.edu/evan-walter-clark-spotte-smith).

Prior to attending UC Berkeley, I received my Bachelor of Science in Materials Science and Engineering from Columbia University
in 2019. During my undergraduate education, I conducted research on nanoparticle self-assembly dynamics with
[Irving P. Herman](http://www.columbia.edu/~iph1/index.html) and explored organic reactions for thermochemical energy
storage applications with [Anubhav Jain](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/) and [Ravi Prasher](https://thermalenergy.lbl.gov/)
of LBNL.
