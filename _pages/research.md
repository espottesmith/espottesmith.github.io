<h2>Automating theoretical studies of (electro)chemical reactivity</h2>
High-throughput density functional theory (DFT) studies of molecules have traditionally been limited to relatively stable species - neutral, closed-shell
species, often in gas phase. However, reactions in electrochemical systems often involve radical, charged, and metal-coordinated species
in a solvent environment. To facilitate studies of such complex and reactive systems, I have been developing
methods to automate calculations of reactive ground-state molecules as well as reaction energy barriers (based on
transition-state theory and Marcus theory), allowing for the accurate prediction of reaction thermodynamics and kinetics
from first-principles.<br>
Using the workflows that I have devised and implemented, it is possible to generate <a href="/files/papers/spottesmith_quantum_chemrxiv_2021.pdf">large datasets</a>
containing the properties of reactive molecules, which allow for the construction of <a href="/files/papers/blau_chemically_2021.pdf">massive chemical reaction networks</a>
and the development of <a href="/files/papers/wen_bondnet_2021.pdf">neural networks</a>, for instance for the prediction of bond dissociation energies.
I am actively working on the development of a similar dataset of reaction pathways, with the eventual goal of machine learning energy barriers for arbitrary
(electro)chemical reactions with DFT-level accuracy.
