Education
======
* M.S./Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering, University of California, Berkeley (2024, expected)
  * Advisor: Professor Kristin Aslaug Persson
  * Thesis: "Understanding Solid Electrolyte Interphase Formation Mechanisms in Mg-ion Batteries"
* B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering, Columbia University (2019)
  * Minor: Sustainable Engineering

Research experience
======
* Graduate Student Researcher, UC Berkeley/LBNL (2019 - present)
  * Advisor: Kristin Aslaug Persson
  * Identify mechanistic origins of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation in Li-ion and Mg-ion batteries.
  * Construct chemical reaction networks based on high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) to reveal optimal reaction pathways.
  * Observe and analyze reactive competition through kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations.
* Undergraduate Student Researcher, LBNL (2018-2019)
  * Advisor: Anubhav Jain
  * Performed computational screening studies of Diels-Alder reactions for liquid-phase thermal energy storage.
  * Using DFT, identified a reaction leading to one of the highest specific heat capacities of any aqueous thermal fluid.
* Lead Undergraduate Researcher, Columbia University (2016-2019)
  * Advisor: Irving P. Herman
  * Studied nanoparticle self-assembly at liquid-liquid and liquid-air interfaces using time-resolved and space-resolvedin situsynchrotron small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS).
  * Developed a novel cell architecture to improve SAXS signal and revealed an unexpected dominant mechanism driving self-assembly kinetics.
  
Teaching experience
